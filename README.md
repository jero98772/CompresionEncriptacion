# Compression & Encryption Project

This project demonstrates the impact of compression and encryption order on different types of files, utilizing several compression and encryption algorithms.

### Libraries

The project uses the `steap-by-steap` library for compression and encryption algorithms. Install it via pip:

```bash
pip install steap-by-steap
```

For more information on `steap-by-steap`, visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jero98772/steap_by_steap).

### Running the Project

To run the project:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Supported File Types

The project supports three types of files:
- **Binary Files**
- **Image Files**
- **Plain Text Files**

### Compression Methods

This project includes the following compression methods:

- **LZW Compression**: A dictionary-based compression algorithm effective for repetitive data, such as plain text.
- **Image FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)**: Used for image compression by transforming image data to the frequency domain.
- **Huffman Compression**: A variable-length encoding algorithm that compresses data based on frequency. This works best with text data where character frequency varies significantly.

For additional details on these methods, refer to the [documentation](https://jero98772.github.io/steap_by_steap/steap_by_steap/compression/index.html).

### Encryption Methods

The project uses the following encryption algorithms:

- **XOR Encryption**: A simple encryption that toggles bits with an XOR operation.
- **Caesar Cipher**: A basic shift cipher.
- **RSA Encryption**: A public-key encryption system that is secure but may increase file size after encryption.

## Conclusions

### Does the Order of Compression and Encryption Matter?

Yes, the effectiveness of compression and encryption can depend on the file type and the specific algorithms used. Some examples include:

- **Huffman Compression**: Effective for plain text due to the frequency-based nature of text data (where some characters appear more often). However, it is less effective for images, where a broad range of colors reduces compression efficiency.
  
- **LZW Compression**: This algorithm groups characters based on repeated patterns, which is more effective for text. When combined with RSA encryption, the encrypted output is larger, as RSA encryption typically expands data.
  
- **Image FFT and Caesar Cipher**: We applied FFT to images followed by Caesar encryption. The Caesar cipher, while simple, added a layer of obfuscation without significantly increasing the image size, making it a suitable option for demonstration purposes.

### Summary

This project demonstrates that the order and choice of compression and encryption algorithms matter and depend on the file type.
